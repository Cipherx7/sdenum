```

### Options:
| Option | Description                                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `-a`   | Use **Amass** for enumeration.                         |
| `-u`   | Use **Sublist3r** for enumeration.                     |
| `-f`   | Use **FFUF** for enumeration.                          |
| `-w`   | Customize wordlists for each tool.                     |
| `-q`   | Quiet mode (suppress the banner).                      |

### Examples:
1. Enumerate subdomains using all tools:
   ```bash
   python3 subdomain.py example.com
   ```

2. Enumerate subdomains using only Amass:
   ```bash
   python3 subdomain.py example.com -a
   ```

3. Customize wordlists:
   ```bash
   python3 subdomain.py -w
   ```

4. Run quietly with FFUF only:
   ```bash
   python3 subdomain.py example.com -f -q
   ```

## Features
1. **Automatic Tool Integration**: Automates the execution of Amass, Sublist3r, and FFUF.
2. **Wordlist Customization**: Allows users to set and save custom wordlists for different tools.
3. **Results Consolidation**: Merges outputs from all tools into a single file for easy reference.
4. **Beginner-Friendly**: Displays a helpful banner and error messages to guide users.
5. **Quiet Mode**: Option to suppress banners for automation or CI/CD pipelines.

---

## To-Do
- Add support for more subdomain enumeration tools.
- Enable multi-threading for faster execution.
- Provide detailed analytics or visualization of results.
- Add Docker support for easier setup.

---

## Examples
### Default Execution:
```bash
python3 subdomain.py example.com
```
Output:
- Amass, Sublist3r, and FFUF will run with default wordlists.
- Results will be saved in `final_output.txt`.

### Customizing Wordlists:
1. Run the tool with the `-w` option:
   ```bash
   python3 subdomain.py -w
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to set custom wordlists for Amass, Sublist3r, and FFUF.
3. Wordlists will be saved and reused for subsequent runs.

### Tool-Specific Execution:
- **Only Amass**:
  ```bash
  python3 subdomain.py example.com -a
  ```
- **Only Sublist3r**:
  ```bash
  python3 subdomain.py example.com -u
  ```
- **Only FFUF**:
  ```bash
  python3 subdomain.py example.com -f
  ```

---

## Output
- **Default File Structure**:
  - `amass_output.txt`: Amass results.
  - `sublist3r_output.txt`: Sublist3r results.
  - `ffuf_output.txt`: FFUF results.
  - `final_output.txt`: Combined results from all tools.

- **Logs**:
  - Errors and informational messages are displayed in the terminal.
